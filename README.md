PennApps_F13_Modulate
=====================

PennApps Fall 2013 app: Modulate.  Unfortunately output .xml files cannot be read by most music editting software.

The project was completed within a 48 hours time period (with sleeping in between).  We worked on the app as a four man team.  Hackers being:  Constanza Figuerola, Darren Yin, David Cerny, and Jonathan Chen, all students of the University of Pennsylvania.

We utilized a basic existing code for a StaXParser to parse through .xml files and write modifications to the files.  The work was split into two teams composed of two members each.  One team worked on the parser/writer and the other team worked on the algorithm to modify the music xml files to change it from minor to major or major to minor.

For the musically challenged: the app was supposed change some notes of a song giving the effect of making "happy" sounding songs into "sad" sounding songs or vice versa.  (My apologies if this is a bad explanation.)
